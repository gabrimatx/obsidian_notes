- The **Max-degree** heuristic does not require extrinsic information because it depends only on the particular problem structure.
- When applying the algorithm write variables' domains for each assignment in the form of: $$1:\{x,y,z,...\}\ ,\ 2:\{y,z,...\}$$
- Create table with degrees of the variables and their updates during the assignment procedure:

| First name | Last name |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Max        | Planck    |
| Marie      | Curie     |
