- When renaming, constants cannot be changed and also you can't rename two different variables into the same constant.
- **Constants** are **functions** of $\text{arity}\ 0$.
- $\text{The formula does not contain free variables} \implies \text{closed formula or sentence}$
- $\text{The formula does not contain any variable} \implies \text{ground formula}$
- $\text{The formula does contains atleast one free variable} \implies \text{open formula}$
- To reduce to clausal form, the procedure is always:
	1. Transform into NNF.
	2. Transform into prenex NNF.
	3. Transform into prenex CNF.
	4. Skolemize.
	5. Remove universal quantifiers.
- The interpretation of predicates is the set for which they evaluate to true.
- Predicates and $\top,\bot$ are atomic formulas.
